# Weather App

My first Front-end project in the Manchester Codes Software Engineering Fast track Bootcamp.

This project uses: 
- Axios to fetch data from an api and display it in a UI
- React hooks such as useState and useEffect
- React testing library
- Stateful and stateless components
- Passing props to child components
